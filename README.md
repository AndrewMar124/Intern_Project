# Intern_Project

For the GSC cyber analyst internship, summer '24, I was given the task of creating an AI tool that would assist leasing agents and employees alike in their searches through company policy.

## Goals

- Gain a foundation in AI and the complexities thereof.
- Learn about the web application lifecycle: DevOps, CI/CD, testing, etc...
- Add to the list of development tools and coding languages that I can use fluently
- minimalist front end / backend design, with little to no loss of functionality
- And of course, finish the project with an exeptional product / tool for GSC.
